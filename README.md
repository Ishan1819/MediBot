## MediBot – Pregnancy Care Chatbot

MediBot is a specialized AI-powered chatbot designed exclusively to support pregnant women by providing accurate, timely, and personalized pregnancy care guidance. Leveraging the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Gemini, MediBot accesses a curated knowledge base of maternity and healthcare information to answer a wide range of pregnancy-related questions — from nutrition and exercise to prenatal checkups and common symptoms.

The chatbot also features convenient tools such as email reminders for important appointments or medication schedules, voice-to-text transcription for hands-free interaction, and text-to-voice conversion to deliver audio responses, making it accessible and easy to use throughout the pregnancy journey. The frontend is built with React.js to offer a smooth and intuitive user experience.
